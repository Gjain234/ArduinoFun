# ArduinoFun
Short Arduino projects I worked on during the summer of 2017 to do various things. These are all modified programs downloaded from the arduino open source code.

The color_controller uses a rotary angle sensor and a lcd backlight screen to display different colors and emotions that relate to those colors. 

The accelerometer_trial uses an accelerometer and a lcd backlight screen to display the updated locations of the x, y, and z coordinates of how the accelerometer moves.

The i2c_touch uses the grove 4-piece touch sensor and the lcd backlight screen to display different ideas and colors based on which sensor is touched.
